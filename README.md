createjs-stickman
=================

After reading David Rouset's (http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2011/07/21/html5-gaming-animating-sprites-in-canvas-with-easeljs.aspx) article on sprite animation I decided to test waters with a stickman sprite test.  Effectively I used adobe's media encoder to create a PNG image sequence. I then took the images and used Flash 6 to create a sprite sheet from the Library and created the following sprite sheet. 
 
After I created the sprite sheet i modified the code David used in his sample and swaped out the sprite png and adjusted the speed and frame registration to match up with the stickman.
